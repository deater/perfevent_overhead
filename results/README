Results from some performance counter overhead calculations.

Currently the graphing programs only plot overhead with time,
although various other useful data are included in the results
file (such as cycle and instruction overhead, overhead
of start/stop times, etc).

The programs used to generate this data can be found in the
perfevent_results-* tarball.

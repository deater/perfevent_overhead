Various programs for exploring the overhead of various
performance counter libraries under Linux.

I need to clean up this code and document it better.

A companion tarball is available with results and programs
for making graphs.

The "prepare_before.sh" script will put the cpufreq governor on
performance, and the various run scripts set the cpu affinity to 
core 0.

Kernels 2.6.36 and 2.6.37 won't let you turn off nmi_watchdog with
/proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog?

HOWTO for ASPLOS results
   make clean/make
   if on a new machine need to edit the files.
     rdtsc_null_pe, rdtsc_null_pe_rdpmc
   edit the make (no longer needed, us uname?)
   run ./prepare_before.sh to disable NMI watchdog, DVFS
   edit ./make_rdtsc_pe_null_results.c ./make_rdtsc_pe_rdpmc_null_results
   make
   run ./make_rdtsc_pe_null_results
   also ./make_rdtsc_pe_rdpmc_null_results
   *NOTE* move old results out of the way before running new scripts

How to generate the graphs/data used in the SIGMETRICS submission:
   Figure 1: Context Switch
             core2_context_switch.jgr
	     
	     Gathering data:
	       Go into context_switch directory.
	       Copy lat_ctx from lmbench in
	       run ./prepare_before.sh
	       run appropriate .sh file
	     Generating plot
	       run "make"
	       run ./plot_results
	       remove extraneous lines and put into jgr file by hand
	     
   Figure 2: Start/Stop/Read amd0fh core2 atom nehalem
   Figure 3: Read            amd0fh core2 atom nehalem
   Figure 4: Start           amd0fh core2 atom nehalem
   Figure 5: Stop            amd0fh core2 atom nehalem
   Figure 6: Varying events
   Figure 7: Taken vs Total amd0fh
   Figure 8: Branch miss percentage amd0fh
   Figure 9: Nehalem -- perf-event vs PAPI events
   
   
--------------------

Various programs for exploring the overhead of various
performance counter libraries under Linux.

I need to clean up this code and document it better.

A companion tarball is available with results and programs
for making graphs.

  http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~vweaver1/projects/perf-events/benchmarks/

The "prepare_before.sh" script will put the cpufreq governor on
performance, and the various run scripts set the cpu affinity to 
core 0.

Kernels 2.6.36 and 2.6.37 won't let you turn off nmi_watchdog with
/proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog?

HOWTO for ASPLOS results
   make clean/make
   if on a new machine need to edit the files.
     rdtsc_null_pe, rdtsc_null_pe_rdpmc
   edit the make (no longer needed, us uname?)
   run ./prepare_before.sh to disable NMI watchdog, DVFS
   edit ./make_rdtsc_pe_null_results.c ./make_rdtsc_pe_rdpmc_null_results
   make
   run ./make_rdtsc_pe_null_results
   also ./make_rdtsc_pe_rdpmc_null_results
   *NOTE* move old results out of the way before running new scripts
